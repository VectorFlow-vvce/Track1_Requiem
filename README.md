**FineHance Omni** is an all-in-one financial assistant that turns the chore of expense tracking into a seamless conversation. By combining **Voice**, **Vision**, **Custom Transformers**, and **Setu Account Aggregator**, it captures every rupee of your spending with zero friction and provides professional-grade financial insights instantly.

## 🌟 The Problem
Most people stop tracking their finances because of **friction**. Opening an app, navigating menus, and typing "₹500 - Food" takes too long. Receipts get lost, voice notes are messy, and manual entry often misses bank-direct transactions (UPI/IMPS).

## ✅ The Solution
FineHance Omni removes the interface entirely. 
- **Talk to it:** Just like a friend (English, Hindi, Malayalam, Tamil, etc.).
- **Show it:** Snap a photo of a receipt.
- **Sync it:** Securely connect your Indian bank accounts via **Setu**.
- **See it:** Get professional analytics on your phone or a dedicated web dashboard.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🎙️ 1. Voice-to-Finance (Powered by Wispr)
Don't type. Just say: *"Hey, I just spent 1200 on petrol at Shell."* 
FineHance Omni transcribes the audio, extracts the amount, and uses a specialized model to categorize it in milliseconds.

### 👁️ 2. Receipt Vision (GPT-4o)
Snap a photo of any thermal receipt or invoice. The system itemizes the entire purchase, extracting:
- Individual line items
- Total amount & Taxes
- Merchant name & Date

### 🧠 3. Custom ML Categorization
Unlike generic trackers, we use a specialized, fine-tuned **MiniLM-L6 Transformer** model:
- **Model:** `CyberKunju/finehance-categorizer-minilm`
- **Precision:** **96.56% Accuracy** across 23 distinct financial categories.
- **Latency:** Ultra-fast inference (~6,600 samples/sec).

### 🏦 4. Automated Indian Bank Sync (Setu)
Powered by the **Setu Account Aggregator** framework.
- **UPI Integration:** Automatically pulls transactions from HDFC, SBI, ICICI, etc.
- **Real-time Reconciliation:** Matches manual logs with bank-direct transactions.
- **Subscription Detection:** Identifies recurring "vampire" payments automatically.

### 🌍 5. South Indian Multilingual Support
Talk to the bot in your native language. We support:
- **Malayalam (മലയാളം)**, **Tamil (தமிழ்)**, **Telugu (తెలుగు)**, **Kannada (ಕನ್ನಡ)**, *English & Hindi*

### 💰 6. Wallet & Account Tracking
Track money across multiple wallets — cash, bank accounts, UPI, credit cards.
- `/wallet cash 5000` — Create a wallet with an initial balance
- `/balance` — View all wallet balances at a glance
- `/transfer cash hdfc 3000` — Move money between wallets
- Every expense auto-deducts from the correct wallet

### 🤝 7. Lending & Borrowing Ledger
Never forget who owes whom.
- `/lend John 500 dinner` — Record money you lent
- `/borrow Sarah 1000 tickets` — Record money you borrowed
- `/debts` — See all outstanding balances at a glance

### 📄 8. PDF Expense Reports
Generate professional PDF reports with charts and transaction tables.
- `/report` — Last 30 days (default)
- `/report 7` — Last 7 days
- Includes category breakdown bar chart + transaction table

### 🌳 9. Hierarchical Spending Summary
See your spending organized in a tree structure by parent category → subcategory.
- `/treesummary` — Beautiful tree-formatted breakdown
```
